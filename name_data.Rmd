## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r name}
library("tidyverse")
name_df <- read.csv("name_gender_dataset.csv")
summary(name_df)
head(name_df)
```
```{r sorting}
#Create a list of the alphabet to iterate through. 
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)


name_df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(initial = str_sub(誰..Name, 1L, 1L)) %>%
  group_by(initial) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE))

letter_df <- read.csv("Count by letter.csv")
head(letter_df)

#variation of names
sum(grepl('^[A]', name_df$誰..Name))

variation_letter_df <- read.csv("variation by letter.csv")
head(variation_letter_df)
```

```{r split}
#split the initial dataframe into male and female dataframes.
male_name_df <- subset(name_df, Gender == "M")
female_name_df <- subset(name_df, Gender == "F")
 
 male_name_df %>%
   rowwise() %>%
   mutate(initial = str_sub(誰..Name, 1L, 1L)) %>%
   group_by(initial) %>%
   summarise(count = sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE))

female_name_df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(initial = str_sub(誰..Name, 1L, 1L)) %>%
  group_by(initial) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE))

male_letter_df <- read.csv("male Count by letter.csv")
female_letter_df <- read.csv("female Count by letter.csv")

head(male_letter_df, 26)
head(female_letter_df, 26)

var_count_df <- read.csv("var_count.csv")
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")

barplot(letter_df$count,names=letter_df$initial, main = "Full count", xlab = "Initial", ylab = "# of people")
barplot(female_letter_df$count,names=letter_df$initial, main = "Female Count", xlab = "Initial", ylab = "# of people")
barplot(male_letter_df$count,names=letter_df$initial, main = "Male Count", xlab = "Initial", ylab = "# of people")

barplot(variation_letter_df$count,names=letter_df$initial, main = "Full variation", xlab = "Initial", ylab = "# of different names")

plot(var_count_df$variation,var_count_df$count)

ggplot(var_count_df, aes(x = variation, y = count)) +
    geom_text(aes(label = initial), size = 4)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r top 100 names}
name_df %>% slice(1:100)
```
